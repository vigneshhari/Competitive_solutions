# pytudes

"An *Ã©tude* (a French word meaning *study*) is an instrumental musical composition, usually short, of considerable difficulty, and designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill." &mdash; [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tude)

This project contains **pytudes**&mdash;Python programs for perfecting programming skills. 

Some are in Jupyter (IPython) notebooks, some in `.py` files. You can view the files here, or clone the project, or run the notebooks online by clicking this button: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/norvig/pytudes/master)

# Etudes for Programmers

I got the idea for the "etudes" part of the name from this [1978 book by Charles Wetherell](https://books.google.com/books/about/Etudes_for_programmers.html?id=u89WAAAAMAAJ)
that was very influential to me when I was learning to program.
