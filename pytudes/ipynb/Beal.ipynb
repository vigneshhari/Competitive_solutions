    "[Andrew Wiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wiles) proved Fermat's theorem in 1995, but Beal's conjecture remains unproved, and Beal has offered [$1,000,000](http://www.ams.org/profession/prizes-awards/ams-supported/beal-prize) for a proof or disproof. I don't have the mathematical skills of Wiles, so I could never find a proof, but I can write a program to search for  counterexamples. I first wrote [that program in 2000](http://norvig.com/beal2000.html), and [my name got associated](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=beal%20conjecture) with Beal's Conjecture, which means I get a lot of emails with purported proofs or counterexamples (many asking how they can collect their prize money). So far, all the emails have been wrong. This page catalogs some of the more common errors and updates my 2000 program."

    "\n",
    "In October 2015 I looked back at my original [program from 2000](http://norvig.com/beal2000.html).\n",
    "I ported it from Python 1.5 to  3.5 (by putting parens around the argument to `print` and adding `long = int`). The program runs 250 times faster today than it did in 2000, a tribute to both computer hardware engineers and the developers of the Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "I found that I was a bit confused about the definition of [the problem in 2000](https://web.archive.org/web/19991127081319/http://bealconjecture.com/).  I thought then that, *by definition*, $A$ and $B$ could not have a common factor, but actually, the definition of the conjecture only rules out examples where all three of $A, B, C$ share a common factor. Mark Tiefenbruck (and later Edward P. Berlin and Shen Lixing) wrote to point out that my thought was actually correct, not by definition, but by derivation: if $A$ and $B$ have a commmon prime factor $p$, then the sum of $A^x + B^y$ must also have that factor $p$, and since $A^x + B^y = C^z$, then $C^z$ and hence $C$ must have the factor $p$. So I was wrong twice, and in this case two wrongs did make a right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mark Tiefenbruck also suggested an optimization: only consider exponents that are odd primes, or 4.  The idea is that a number like 512 can be expressed as either $2^9$ or $8^3$, and my program doesn't need to consider both. In general, any time we have a composite exponent, such as $b^{qp}$, where $p$ is prime, we should ignore $b^{(qp)}$, and instead consider only $(b^q)^p$. There's one complication to this scheme: 2 is a prime, but 2 is not a valid exponent for a Beal counterexample.  So we will allow 4 as an exponent, as well as all odd primes up to `max_x`.\n",

For example, what if $2^7 = 5^3 = s$; then wouldn't we have to have both 2 and 5 as values for $s$ in the table?

In another sense, there is a difference. With this optimization, when we run `beal(6, 10)`, we are no longer testing $512$ as a value of $A$ or $B$, even though $512 = 2^9$ and both $2$ and $9$ are within range, because the program chooses to express $512$ as $8^3$, and $8$ is not in the specified range.

    "We don't see a speedup here, but the idea is that as we start dealing with much larger integers, this version should be faster. I could improve this version by caching certain computations, managing the memory layout better, moving some computations out of loops, considering using multiple different numbers as the modulus (as in a Bloom filter), finding a way to parallelize the program, and re-coding in a faster compiled language (such as C++ or Go or Julia). Then I could invest thousands (or millions) of CPU hours searching for counterexamples. \n",

So I don't think it is worthwhile to continue on that path.\n",

I suggest you work on a proof rather than a counterexample, or work on some other interesting problem instead!"
