    "Now let's think about how to speed that up. I don't want to have to consider every possible string, because there are too many ($k^k$) of them. Can I group together many strings and just count the number of them, without enumerating each one? For example, if I knew there were 52 valid strings of length $k-1$ (and didn't know anything else about them), can I tell how many valid strings of length $k$ there are? I don't see a way to do this directly, because the number of ways to extend a valid string is dependent on the number of distinct characters in the string. If a string has $m$ distinct characters, then I can extend it in $m$ waysby repeating any of those $m$ characters, or I can introduce a first occurrence of character number $m+1$ in just 1 way.\n",

    "So I need to keep track of the number of valid strings of length $k$ that have exactly $m$ distinct characters (those characters must be exactly `range(m)`). I'll call that number `C(k, m)`. Because I can reach a recursive call to `C(k, m)` by many paths, I will use the `cache` decorator to keep track of the computations that I have already done. Then I can define `how_many(k)` as the sum over all values of `m` of `C(k, m)`:"

You can combine sides in a variety of ways: for example, you could create a set of rectangles with dimensions 1 x 3, 2 x 4, 5 x 7, 6 x 8 and 9 x 10. How many different sets of five rectangles are possible?*\n",

So divide 10! by 2<sup>5</sup> to account for the fact that each of 5 rectangles can appear 2 ways.  Similarly, if we fill A and B with 1 &times; 3, that yields the same set as if we filled C and D with 1 &times; 3.  So divide again by 5!
