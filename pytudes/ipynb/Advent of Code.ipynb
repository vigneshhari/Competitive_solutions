    "\n",
    "From Dec. 1 to Dec. 25, [I](http://norvig.com) will be solving the puzzles that appear each day at *[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/)*. The two-part puzzles are released at midnight EST (9:00PM PST); points are awarded to the first 100 people to solve the day's puzzles. The code shown here basically represents what I did to solve the problem, but slightly cleaned up:\n",
    "- On days when I start at 9:00PM and am competing against the clock, I take shortcuts. I use shorter names, because I'm not a fast typist. I run test cases in the Jupyter Notebook, but don't make them into `assert` statements. Even then, I'm not really competitive with the fastest solvers.\n",
    "- On days when I didn't get a chance to start until after all the points are gone, what you see here is pretty much exactly what I did, or at least what I ended up with after correcting typos and other errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand the problems completely, you will have to read the full description in the **\"[Day 1](http://adventofcode.com/2016/day/1):\"** link in each day's section header.\n",

    "\n",
    "- I'll import my favorite modules and functions, so I don't have to do it each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "- From  looking at [last year's](http://adventofcode.com/2015) puzzles, I knew that there would be a data file on many days, so I defined the function `Input` to open the file (and for those using this notebook on a remote machine, to fetch the file from the web). My data files are at [http://norvig.com/ipython/advent2016/](http://norvig.com/ipython/advent2016/).\n",

Fo example, with 12 elves in a circle (like a clock face), Elf 1 takes from Elf 7. With an odd number of elves, directly across the circle falls between two elves, so choose the one that is earlier in the circle. For example, with 11 elves, Elf 2 takes from the Elf at position 7. Now who ends up with the presents?\n",

But I can represent the circle as a list and write a loop to eliminate elves one at a time. Again, if I did that with a `del` statement for each elf, it would be O(*N*<sup>2</sup>). But if instead I do one round at a time, replacing each eliminated elf with `None` in the list, and then filtering out the `None` values, then each round is only O(*N*), and sine there will be log(*N*) rounds, the whole thing is only O(*N* log(*N*)).

But we have to skip over the already-eliminated spaces; we can do that by keeping track of the number of eliminated elves in the variable `eliminated`. We also need to keep track of the current value of `N`, since it will change. And, since I don't want to deal with the headaches of wrapping around the circletconn, I will only deal with the first third of the elves: the first third all eliminate elves in the other two-thirds; if we went more than 1/3 of the way through, we would have to worry about wrapping around. (I had a bug here: at first I just iterated through `N // 3`. But when `N` is 2, that does no iteration at all, which is wrong; with two elves, the first should eliminate the other. It turns out it is safe to iterate through `ceil(N /3)` on each round.)\n",

    "In this puzzle we are asked to take a password string, scramble it according to a list of instructions, and output the result, which will be a permutation of the original password. This is tedious because there are seven different instructions, but each one is pretty straightforward. I make the following choices:\n",
    "- I'll transform `password` (a `str`) into `pw` (a `list`), because lists are mutable and easier to manipulate. At the end I'll turn it back into a `str`.\n",
    "- I'll define functions `rot` and `swap` because they get used multiple times by different instructions.\n",
    "- I use the variables `A, B` to denote the first two integers anywhere in a line. If there is only one integer (or none), then `B` (and `A`) get as a default value `0`. I  accept ill-formed instructions, such as `\"move 1 to 4\"` instead of requiring `\"move position 1 to position 4\"`. \n"

We are asked to find the lowest positive integer value for register `a` that causes the program to output an infinite series of `0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, ...` signals. Dealing with infinity is difficult, so I'll approximate that by asking: what is the lowest value for register `a` that causes the program to output at least 100 elements in the `0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, ...` series, within the first million instructions executed?\n",
