    "# Bad Grade, Good Experience\n",

    "Recently I was asked a question I hadn't thought about before: \n",
    "\n",
    "> *As a student, did you ever get a bad grade on a programming assignment?* \n",
    "\n",
    "I've forgotten most of my assignments, but there is one I do remember. It was something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Concordance Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Using the [`Snobol`](http://www.snobol4.org/) language, read lines of text from the standard input and print a *concordance*, which is an alphabetized list of words in the text, with the line number(s) where each word appears. Words with different capitalization (like \"A\" and \"a\") should be merged into one entry.*\n",
    "\n",
    "After studying Snobol a bit, I realized that the expected solution was along these lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create an empty `dict` (Snobol calls these \"tables\") whose keys will be words and values will be lists of line numbers.\n",
    "2. Read the lines of text (tracking the line numbers), split them into words, and build up the list of line numbers for each word.\n",
    "3. Convert the table into a two-dimensional `array` where each row has the two columns `[word, line_numbers]`.\n",
    "4. Write a function to sort the array alphabetically (`sort` is not built-in to Snobol).\n",
    "5. Write a function to print the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "That would be around 40 to 60 lines of code; an easy task. But I noticed three interesting things about Snobol:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   There is an *indirection* operator, `$`, so if the variable `'X'` has the value `\"A\"`, then `'$X = i'` is the same as `'A = i'`.\n",
    "*   Uninitialized variables are treated as the empty string, so `'A += \"text\"'` works even if  we haven't seen `'A'` before.\n",
    "*   When the program ends, the Snobol interpreter automatically\n",
    "prints the values of every variable, sorted alphabetically, as a debugging aid.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means I could do away with the `dict` and `array` data structures, eliminating steps 1, 3, 4, and 5, and just do step 2! \n",
    "\n",
    "# The Concordance Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "I ended up with a program similar to the following (translated from Snobol to Python, but with `'$word'` indirection):"

It turns out that *I flunked an AI course!* (Or at least, didn't complete it.) This course was offered by Prof. Richard Millward in the Cognitive Science program.  I certainly remember a lot of influential material from this class: we read David Marr, we read Winston's just-published *Psychology of Computer Vision*, we read a chapter from Duda and Hart which was then only a few years old. The things I learned in that course have stuck with me for decades, but one thing that didn't stick is that, according to my transcript, I never completed the course! I'm not sure what happened. I did an independent study with Ulf Grenander that semester; my best guess\n",
