"""A framework for running unit tests and examples, written in docstrings.

This lets you write "Ex: sqrt(4) ==> 2; sqrt(-1) raises ValueError" in a
docstring, and then execute the examples as unit tests.

This functionality is similar to the doctest module.  The major
differences between docex and doctest are:

(1) Brevity.  With docex you write the one-line comment
    "Ex: len('abc') ==> 3; len([]) ==> 0; len(5) raises TypeError"
    With doctest you would need 9 lines for the same thing:
    '''>>> len('abc')
    3
    >>> len([])
    0
    >>> len(5))
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    TypeError: len() of unsized object
    '''

(2) Docex handles both examples and unit tests.
    It took me a while to recognize this distinction: when I write
    "sqrt(4) ==> 2" it has two purposes -- to serve as a unit test
    and to serve as an example of how to use the sqrt function.
    When I write "random.choice('abc')" it serves as an example of
    how to use the choice function, but it is not a unit test.
    docex lets you do both; doctest only supports tests.  Of course
    you can coerce this into a test in doctest, with something like
    >>> random.choice('abc') in 'abc'
    True

(3) Eval-based rather than string-comparison based.  The docex string
    "dict(zip([1,4,9], [1,2,3])) ==> {1: 1, 4: 2, 9: 3}" works even
    when a different version of Python decides to print the dict as
    "{9: 3, 4: 2, 1: 1}" because docex evals the right-hand-side and
    checks to see if it is equal.  That's good for dicts, its good for
    writing "1+1==2 ==> True" and having it work in versions of Python
    where True prints as "1" rather than as "True", and so on,
    but doctest has the edge if you want to compare against something
    that doesn't have an eval-able output, or if you want to test 
    printed output.

(4) Doctest has many more features, and is better supported.
    I wrote docex before doctest was an official part of Python, but
    with the refactoring of doctest in Python 2.4, I decided to switch
    my code over to doctest, even though I prefer the brevity of docex. 
    I still offer docex for those who want it.

From Python, when you want to test modules m1, m2, ... do:
    docex.Docex([m1, m2, ...])
From the shell, when you want to test files *.py, do:
    python docex.py [log-file] *.py
If log file ends in .htm or .html, it will be written in HTML.
If log file is -, or if it is missing, then standard output is used.

For each module, Docex looks at the __doc__ and _docex strings of the
module itself, and of each member, and recursively for each member
class.  If a line in a docstring starts with r'^\s*Ex: ' (a line with
blanks, then 'Ex: '), then the remainder of the string after the colon
is treated as examples. Each line of the examples should conform to
one of the following formats:

    (1) Blank line or a comment; these just get echoed verbatim to the log.
    (2) Of the form example1 ; example2 ; ...
    (3) Of the form 'x ==> y' for any expressions x and y.
            x is evaled and assigned to _, then y is evaled.
            If x != y, an error message is printed.
    (4) Of the form 'x raises y', for any statement x and expression y.
            First y is evaled to yield an exception type, then x is execed.
            If x doesn't raise the right exception, an error msg is printed.
    (5) Of the form 'statement'. Statement is execed for side effect.
    (6) Of the form 'expression'. Expression is evaled for side effect.
